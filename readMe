- Responsive and interactive UI for managing events.
- RESTful API for backend communication.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core (for database interactions)
- SQL Server (default database, can be configured)

### Frontend:
- Angular
- TypeScript

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Angular CLI (v15 or later)
- .NET 6 SDK
- SQL Server
- Git

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/mirodildev/WAD.CODEBASE.00022145.git
   
2. Navigate to the backend folder:
   
   cd WAD.CODEBASE.00022145/Backend
   
3. Restore dependencies:
   
   dotnet restore
   
4. Update appsettings.json to configure your database connection.
5. Apply database migrations:
   
   dotnet ef database update
   
6. Run the backend API:
   
   dotnet run
   
   The API should now be running at https://localhost:7189.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   
   cd WAD.CODEBASE.00022145/Frontend
   
2. Install dependencies:
   
   npm install
   
3. Start the development server:
   
   ng serve
   
   The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:4200.

## Usage

1. Open the frontend application at http://localhost:4200.
3. Use the dashboard to create, edit, delete, or view events.
